The Tang Lab is part of the Stephenson School of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Oklahoma.

Our research focuses on advanced biomedical imaging and translational technologies, with particular emphasis on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and its applications in liver transplantation, tissue viability assessment, and microstructural characterization.

By integrating engineering innovation with clinical collaboration, we aim to develop imaging tools that enable real-time, high-resolution evaluation of biological tissues and support improved clinical decision-making.
